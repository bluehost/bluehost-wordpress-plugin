# Atomic Design

The Bluehost Plugin WordPress Admin application is organized using an Atomic Design system.

Atomic design draws from chemistry concepts and vocabulary to classify components in a reusable design system.

## Components Are Grouped Into...

From smallest (and most reusable) to largest (and often bespoke):

* Atoms (reusable)
* Molecules (reusable)
* Organisms (potentially reusable)
* Templates (reusable)
* Pages (unique)

## Understanding Atoms

Atoms are the smallest, reusable unit of Components in a system.

#### Identifying characteristics
* Atoms are highly-reusable throughout an interface.
* Atoms never contain other Atoms.
* Atoms are in their most elemental form -- they cannot be further reduced without ceasing to be functional.
* Atoms _often_ render as a single element.

Atoms can be as simple as a Heading, Paragraph or Input field.

Currently, our system isn't _perfectly_ atom-ized -- we do not have Atoms for every HTML element nor do we have Atoms to handle layout positioning. In a perfectly atom-ized system, almost every Atom would lack an element hiearchy. Instead, our guiding principle is Atoms don't contain other Atoms and from a visual/UX standpoint are distilled to their elemental use. While our Toggle contains `<label>` and `<input>` elements, we don't have an `Input` Atom and the benefits of atom-izing an Input are few compared to the complexity.

So, in our system, there are a few exceptions to the single-element rule.

1. A few HTML elements are used, perhaps using a wrapper to provide positioning, spacing or sizing.
2. If the design system doesn't contain Atoms for inputs/labels, a Toggle component could be considered an Atom, despite being multiple HTML elements.

As a result, as we refine our system, some Atoms may evolve into Molecules.

Examples:
* Paragraph
* Heading
* Input field
* Image
* Button
* Box
* Column

## Understanding Molecules

Molecules vary widely in size and complexity and are often the most common type of Component in a system.

In general, Molecules are a composition of Atoms & HTML elements.

#### Identifying characteristics
* Molecules are repeatable & composable throughout the interface across pages -- non-composable components are Organisms.
* Molecules are composed of Atoms, HTML elements -- **not other Molecules**.
* Molecules should aim to be agnostic of _purpose_ -- Cards over Product Cards, Section over Home Section.
* Molecules may change drastically in visual style based on Props, but contain the same structure of Atoms & Elements.

Examples:
* Search field (with Input and Button atoms).
* Button Group
* Cards
* List sections

## Organisms

Organisms are discrete parts of an interface that may contain smaller organisms, molecules, atoms and HTML elements.

#### Identifying characteristics
* Organisms are... 
    * Top-level design pieces (Headers, Footers, Sidebars)
    * Complex, repeatable and composable pieces (Call-to-action Hero containing multiple Molecules)
    * Bespoke, repeatable but not composable pieces (Newsletter signup, Menu items, Street address & Map)
* Organisms are composed of Atoms, HTML elements and/or Molecules.
* Organisms often have a specific purpose.

Examples:
* Headers
* Navigation
* Sidebars
* Setting Groups
* Grids
* Footers

## Templates

Templates are top-level layouts that give Pages their structure.

Templates can extend other Templates. In the Bluehost Plugin WordPress Admin app, we have a Base Template, Common Template and Marketplace Template.

#### Identifying characteristics
* Templates provide the layout rhythm and style for the **entire** page -- they are the wireframe blueprint.
* Templates should not be implemented _inside_ other Templates (those are Organisms) -- they should only extend other Templates.
* Templates aren't partial pieces of the Page (Organisms) -- they aren't headers, footers, sidebars or blocks assembled.

Examples:
* Base
* Common
* Marketplace

## Pages

Pages implement a Template and contain unique combinations of Organisms, Molecules, Atoms and information.

In our system, we have both Static Pages and Dynamic Pages. Our Static Pages have "burned-in" properties, even if the strings are translatable. Our dynamic pages rely on route params (like product ID) to render.

While a Dynamic Page may implement a Template, it is a Page because it has a specified Route, despite having dynamic contents.
